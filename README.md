# Paper Finder

Paper Finder is a single-tier Marklogic web application prototype that tries to take some of the stress out of an academic's search for new, relevant journal articles.

It allows logged in users to subscribe to journal RSS feeds and apply simple searches to the articles in the feeds.  In a production version, matching articles would be packaged as a secondary RSS feed, allowing users to browse results in any feed reader and the application would already know about lots of journal RSS feeds.  In this prototype, new results are displayed on a web page, you have to tell the application about the feeds, and it only understands RSS 1.0.

The motivation for building this application came from a short twitter exchange I had with a working chemist in 2014 that indicated that existing discovery tools were not responsive enough because of inherent delays in academic publishing workflows.
